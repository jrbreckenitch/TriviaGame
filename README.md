Description

This app is a basic trivia game. It gives the user four options for each question and allows the user to only select one option. There is also a timer of 120 seconds. The user must answer the questions before the timer runs out. Once the timer runs out the questions clear off the screen and the score page is displayed. The score page shows how many questions were answered correctly, incorrectly, or were unanswered.
