# TriviaGame

Description

This app is a basic trivia game. It gives the user four options for each question and allows the user to only select one option. There is also a timer of 120 seconds. The user must answer the questions before the timer runs out. Once the timer runs out the questions clear off the screen and the score page is displayed. The score page shows how many questions were answered correctly, incorrectly, or were unanswered.


Motivation

The motivation for this game was to build an app with jQuery that would give the user a series of of options (questions in this case) and only allow them to choose one and then return a specific result based on the option the user chose.  

Improvements

The main improvement I would like to make to this app in the future is allowing the user to submit their answeres before the timer runs out.  So if the user finishes early they won't have to wait additional time.
